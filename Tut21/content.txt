-> CSS Specificity & Cascade 

In CSS, to resolve conflicts "Cascade Algorithm" is there.

CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to HTML element(s).
Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
        ~> When we have to compare among same type of selectors.

    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
        ~> The order of specificity is :
           inline style > ID selector > class or pseudoclass or attribute selector > element selector > universal selector 

    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
        ~> If we don't use CSS, then browser use its own Stylesheet, known as "User-Agent Stylesheet".
        ~> This will be overridden if we specify any styling.

    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the "!important" rule type
        ~> If this "!important" is specified after some styling, that will overrirde any other same type of stylings.
        ~> Then inline-style will also be overrirden.
