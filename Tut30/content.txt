    ~> Uisng variables we can change the different aspects of the whole web-page with the single chnage in variable values
    ~> Here in CSS, variables are defined in different ways

    ~> First using the "root", we can define the global variables
    ~> Now if we use the same variable name inside some element's styling 
       giving it some different value, then that will be applicable as being the local variable 
       and by overriding the global one.
