CSS FlexBox

The following properties are applied on the "container" (parent of the items) :
    ~> display: flex; [then only we can apply flex properties]
    ~> properties for 
        -> "justify-content: ;"
        -> "align-items: ;"
    ~> flex direction
    ~> flex axis
        -> main axis [main start and main end], [main size]
        -> cross axis [cross start and cross end], [cross size]
    ~> flex wrap
        -> in order to resolve the overflowing case
        -> nowrap is the default value

    ~> align-content
        -> different from "align-items"
        -> shift multiple main axes together as we want
    
    ~> There is no "justify-items" in flexbox 

    ~> flex-flow
        -> flex-flow: <flex-direction> || <flex-wrap>

    ~> gap properties :
        -> gap
        -> gap: <row-gap> || <column-gap>
        -> row-gap & column-gap 

The following properties are applied on the items :
    ~> order (default value 0)
    ~> flex-grow (default value 0)
    ~> flex-shrink (default value 1)
    ~> align-self
