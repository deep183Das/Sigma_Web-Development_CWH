!! Questions :

Q.1> My browser may not support each and every type of file. Then how to resolve that issue while creating a generic web page for everyone.
    -> One solution is to convert those file formats into more popular and standard file formats before using in your webpage.

Q.2> How to calculate "specificity" numerically ?
    -> To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
        Universal Selector: 0
        Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
        Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
        ID selectors: 100
        Inline styles: 1000
    An  !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points.

    Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector(for complex selectors).
        e.g. <h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
    Here, the specificity value will be 111 because ID has a specificity of 100, the class has a specificity of 10, and the h1 element has a specificity of 1.

    In the case of a specificity tie, the rule that appears last in the CSS is applied.

Q.3> What will be the specificity value of the following selector:
        a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
            color: red;
        }

    -> To calculate the specificity value of the selector "a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover", you can break down its components:

        Element selectors: "a" contributes 1 point.
        Class selectors: ".harryclass" and ".rohan-class" each contributes 10 points, totaling 20 points.
        Attribute selector: "[href]" contributes 10 points.
        Pseudo-class: ":hover" adds another 10 points.
    Add up all these values:

    1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute) + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41.

    So, the specificity value of the selector "a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover" will be 41.


!! Suggestions :

S.1> "right click -> view page source" to watch the web page's sourse code.

S.2> "ctrl + enter" -> will take your cursor to the exact next line with the same indentation of the previous line 
                       irrespective of whereever you were in the previous line.

S.3> "windows + shift + s" -> to open the snipping tool
S.4> "windows + alt + r" -> screen recording 
S.5> "windows + h" -> audio text writing
S.6> "windows + d" -> to close and open all the tabs together
S.7> "windows + tab" -> to get the view of all the opened app  
S.8> "alt + tab" -> to open the last opened tab
