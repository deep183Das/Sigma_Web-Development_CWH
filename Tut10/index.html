        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" add this to the src tag as attribute in the img.svg file.

videos :
    src    -> specifies the path to the video file
    controls -> which controls will be added to your video, that is decided by the browser itself
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    poster -> specifies an image to be displayed before the video starts playing
    height and width
 -->

<!-- 
audio :
    src
    controls -> adds audio cotrols like play, pause and volume
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    preload -> specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads
        The "preload" attribute can have the following values:
        -> none 
            This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file at all. 
            The audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.
        -> metadata
            This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file, such as its duration and basic 
            information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to the user without 
            fully loading the audio data.
        -> auto
            This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible without delaying the 
            loading of other important page content. The browser will try to load the audio file in the background so that 
            it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.
    (if you want the browser to fetch(go and get) the data beforehand, then use "preload" attribute otherwise not)

    SVG is a format by which we can create images of high graphics (vector images)

    (SVG)Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, 
    having support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard, developed 
    by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1999.
