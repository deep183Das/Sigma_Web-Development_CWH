Introduction to CSS
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that is 
    used to describe the visual presentation of a web page written in HTML.

    HTML creates the structure of the page, while
    CSS adds styling to that structure.

There are selectors in CSS which are used to target HTML elements to style them.
