Introduction to Web Development
 
~ Website works with :
client 
browser     
server 

Client asks for a specific page(e.g. YouTube) from a browser (e.g. Google), it will then asks the youtube page from its server and 
server is maintaining its code and it's on the browser that how the site will be presented to us. The response code is 200 usually. 
Either the webpage is available or not or some server error (some kind of server response we will get, that will be parsed through the browser).

You can see the sourse code of a page by "right click" and see "view page source" or for any further request view "inspect"
404 -> the error response
200 -> the ok response

~ Now what is "Backend" ?
    The Backend is the server side of the Website.
    It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side works fine.
    It is a part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
    It is the portion of the software that does not come in direct conatct with the user.

~ Frontend uses 
    HTML : structure
    CSS  : style sheet
    JS   : makes the webpage dynamic (client side scripting)
