<!-- It's a good seo practice to give the title related to content details -->
<!-- Along with title, "meta description" is also very important for a website to get a high 
    rank according to relevance to user's search query -->

<!-- Now-a-days, our web page's content is parsed, so SEOs don't look for meta-keywords anymore. It has become deprecated. -->
