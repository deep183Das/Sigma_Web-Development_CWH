Introduction to JavaScript & Installing Node.js
    ~> JS is a client-side scripting language and is used to make our webpage dynamic (frontend component)

    ~> JS can also be used to make backends using Node.js 

    ~>  (in terminal)
        node --version
            v20.10.0
    
    NPM is also by-default installed. It is "Node Package Manager" which helps us instaling packages in our NODE.js and even we can 
    use other's code in our NODE program
        (in terminal)
        npm 
        npm --version
            10.2.3

    ~>  NODE.js is basically JS V8 engine which chrome uses to run our scripts
        Ryan Dahl put it into a C++ program and then onwards we can use the power of JS inside our computer system
        So now we can run our JS programs using NODE similarly as we did with our python program using PyCharm
    
    But some things written in our scripts (e.g. prompt, confirm, alert) won't run in NODE as they are only available in chrome
        (in terminal (being within this specific folder) which contains the following JS files)
        node .\script.js (or just "node script.js")     --> will throw an error showing "alert is not defined"

        node .\new.js                                   --> no error and all the console.log messages will be printed

    ~> in browser we get some extra "prompt" like activities which we don't get while using our JS script using NODE.
       on the other side, using NODE we can carry out file reading and writing which can not be done using browser.
