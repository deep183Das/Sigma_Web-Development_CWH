Inline Elements 
--> They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

Block-level Elements
--> They are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container "by default". 
    They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line. 

(this display property can be set by CSS)
