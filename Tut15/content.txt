Inline, Internal and External CSS _ These are the three ways to add CSS in the HTML file.

Inline CSS    ->  This is used in an HTML page using "style" attributes of several HTML elements.

Internal CSS  ->  It means to add a "style" tag and place the HTML page's style within it.

External CSS  ->  It means to create a ".css" file and place all your styles inside that ".css" file.
