CSS Fonts, Texts, Color properties

~> While choosing fonts, it's a good practice to choose at least one generic font, so that
   if the user doesn't have the font, then there will be no problem. 

~> Check different fonts how they look [ https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/yLojraG ]

~> To use external fonts in webpage, search in google (google fonts) [ https://fonts.google.com/ ]
   to browse external fonts.
   --> we can either "import" that or get a "link" 
   --> use the font family in the CSS file or in the style tag
   --> paste the link inside the "head" tag or paste the import link inside the "style" tag

~> a popular external font --> "Poppins"

~> We can import several fonts all at once with url import link available. It's recommended to 
   import multiple fonts at a time but not too many also.
