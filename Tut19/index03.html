    <h1>Let's learn about colors</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Useful <a href="https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/ZELGraM" target="_blank">site</a> for colors in CSS. It's a comprehensive list of the colors available in CSS.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Color can be represented in :
        <ol>
            <li>Color Keywords</li>
            e.g. "red", "blue" etc

            <li>Hex Color Code</li>
            e.g. red(<strong>#FF0000</strong>) etc and
            choose the hex code(and corresponding "RGB" and "HSL" code also) from <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            
            <li>RGB(Red, Green, Blue)</li>
            e.g. red(<strong>rgb(255,0,0)</strong>) and here each value is from 0 to 255 inclusive.

            <li>RGBA(Red, Green, Blue, alpha)</li>
            e.g. red(<strong>rgb(255,0,0, 1)</strong>) and here "alpha" varies from 0 to 1 inclusive.

            <li>HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness)</li>
            e.g. red(<strong>hsl(0,100%,50%)</strong>)
            <ul>
                <li>Hue(h)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.</li>
                        <li>0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Saturation(S)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.</li>
                        <li>0% saturation is no color (grayscale),  and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Lightness(L)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.</li>
                        <li>0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        </ol>
